        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This warm juicy grapefruit with a buttery sweet topping is the perfect
            accompaniment to your Sunday brunch and also makes a lovely dessert or
            snack. I like to add a pinch of sea salt at the end to really bring out
            the flavors.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <p><ul>
                <li>1 red grapefruit, refrigerated</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon softened butter</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>aluminum foil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p> <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p> Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F(200 degrees C).</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p> Cut grapefruit in half crosswire and slice off a thin sliver
                off the bottom of each half if the fruit isn't sitting flat. 
                Use a sharp paring knife to cut around the outside edge of the 
                grapefruit and between each segment to make the fruit to eat 
                once cooked.
            </p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Combine softened butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar in a small
                bowl. Spread mixture over each grapefruit half. Sprinkle with 
                remaining brown sugar.
            </p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Cut aluminum foil into two 5-inch squares and place each grapefruit
                half on one square; fold up the edges to catch any juices. Set in 
                the air fryer basket.
            </p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>Broil in the air fryer until sugar mixture is bubbling, 6 to 7
                minutes. Sprinkle fruit with cinnamon before serving.
            </p>
        </ol></p>
