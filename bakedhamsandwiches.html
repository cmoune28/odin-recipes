            <li>3/4 cup of melted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershite sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion</li>
            <li>24 mini sandwich rolls</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked deli ham</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced Swiss cheese</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degree C).
                Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>
                In a bowl, mix together butter, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce,
                poppy seeds, and dried onion. Separate the tops from bottoms of the rolls,
                and place the bottom pieces into the prepared baking dish. Layer about half
                the ham onto the rolls. Arrange the Swiss cheese over the ham, and top with 
                remaining ham slices in a layer. Place the tops of the rolls onto the 
                sandwiches. Pour the mustard mixture evenly over the rolls.
            </p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the rolls are lightly browned and the cheese 
                has melted, about 20 minutes. Slice into individual rolls through the
                ham and cheese layers to serve.
            </p>
